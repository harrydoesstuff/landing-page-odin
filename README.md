# landing-page-odin
The landing page project that ends the FlexBox/CSS section of The Odin Project

After looking at the images, looks like I'll initially need 6 divs within the body to get the basic structure of the site. 

main divs and their sub divs: 

1. header
    header-logo
    header-links
2. title
    awesome-title
    awesome-text
    signup
    title-image
3. information
    random
    image-square (4)
    image-text
4. quote
    quote-body
    thor
5. action
    call-container
    call-title
    call-text
    call-signup
6. footer

I think that'll be all the required divs for now. My plan is to start out by just getting as close to the sample images as possible. Later, I might link this to my Testing Grounds page and maybe try and make it more relevant to either a topic I'm learning or some random stuff.
